                    <h3>What is Java and why do I need to learn?</h3>
                    Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It
                    has evolved from humble beginnings to power a large share of today’s digital world, by providing the
                    reliable platform upon which many services and applications are built. New, innovative products and
                    digital services designed for the future continue to rely on Java, as well.

                    There are many applications and even some websites that will not function unless you have Java
                    installed. Java.com, this website, is intended for consumers who require Java for their desktop
                    applications – specifically applications targeting Java 8. Developers as well as users that would
                    like to learn Java programming should visit the <a href="https://dev.java/">dev.java</a> website
                    instead and business users should visit <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/">oracle.com/java</a>
                    for more information.

                <section>In Java, the word method refers to the same kind of thing that the word function is used for in
                    other languages. Specifically, a method is a function that belongs to a class. In Java, every
                    function belongs to a class.</section>

                    <h3>What is OOPs?</h3>
                    Object-oriented programming is a method used for designing a program using classes and objects.
                    Object-oriented programming is also called the core of java. Object-oriented programming organizes a
                    program around objects and well-defined interfaces.

                    <h3>What is OOPs in java? </h3>
                    OOps in java is to improve code readability and reusability by defining a Java program efficiently.
                    The main principles of object-oriented programming are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and
                    polymorphism. These concepts aim to implement real-world entities in programs.
