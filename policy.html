                    When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big
                    responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.

                    Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example,
                    if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.

                    We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example,
                    we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your
                    Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or
                    improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in
                    order to help solve any issues you might be facing.

                    We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and
                    responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.
