                <h2>Why Java</h2>
                <p>
                    Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have
                    as
                    few
                    implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended
                    to
                    let
                    programmers write once, run anywhere, meaning that compiled Java code can run on all
                    platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.

                <h2>Why .Net</h2>
                <p>
                    The .NET Framework (pronounced as "dot net") is a proprietary software framework developed by
                    Microsoft
                    that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It was the predominant implementation of the Common
                    Language
                    Infrastructure (CLI) until being superseded by the cross-platform .NET project.
